## About this course

In this course, we will provide an introduction to the basic concepts and functionalities of `R` and go through a prototypical data analysis workflow: import, wrangling, exploration, (basic) analysis, and reporting. 

By the end of this course you should...

- be comfortable with using `R` and *RStudio*
- be able to import, wrangle, and explore your data with `R`
- be able to create/conduct basic visualizations and analyses of your data with `R`
- be able to generate reproducible research reports using `R Markdown`

--

**Note**: This is not a statistics workshop. Our focus will be on learning how to use `R`.

.small[
- **Import**: read in data in different formats (e.g., .csv, .xls, .sav, .dta)
- **Tidy**: clean data (1 row = 1 case, 1 column = 1 variable), rename & recode variables, etc.
- **Transform**: prepare data for analysis (e.g., by aggregating and/or filtering)
- **Visualize**: explore/analyze data through informative plots
- **Model**: analyze the data by creating models (e.g, linear regression model) 
- **Communicate**: present the results (to others)

## Workshop Structure & Materials

- The workshop consists of a combination of lectures and hands-on exercises

- For the time after the workshop sessions each day, we have also prepared some optional (and hopefully fun) "extracurricular activities"

- Slides and other materials are available at

## A very brief history of `R`

- `R` was created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the Department of Statistics at the University of Auckland (NZ) in 1993
- The `R` *Core Group* that has been responsible for the development of `R` since then and `CRAN` were founded in 1997
- version `1.0.0` of `R` was released in 2000
- *RStudio* was initially released in 2011
- currently, the most recent version of `R` is `4.2.1` (released 2022-06-23)<sup>1</sup>

If you want to know a bit more about the origins and history of `R` as well as the philosophy behind it, the book [*R Programming for Data Science*](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/rprogdatascience/) by Roger D. Peng provides a [good summary](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/rprogdatascience/history-and-overview-of-r.html). You can also watch this [*YouTube* video in which David Smith talks about *Twenty Years of R*](https://youtu.be/iq_biXEIx-U).

[1] Fun fact: The different versions of `R` also have (nick)names. The current version `4.2.1`, e.g., is called 'Funny-Looking Kid'.
